# Natural Town Growth (Mod.io Edition)

This mod enhances the **Natural Town Growth** system for Transport Fever 2 by making it configurable, performance-friendly, and more balanced.

## ‚ú® Features
- Smooth growth progression (no runaway exponential growth)
- Configurable max town size and growth rate
- Performance-friendly update intervals
- Growth influenced by cargo delivery and transport reachability
- Optional decay system (towns shrink if undersupplied or isolated)
- Traffic penalty slows growth when roads are congested

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Edit the `config.lua` file to customize gameplay.

Example parameters:
```lua
growthBlendFactor = 0.5    -- Blend between starting capacity and calculated growth
maxTownSize = 5000         -- Cap for town population
updateIntervalMonths = 3   -- Update frequency (higher = better performance)
cargoInfluence = 1.0       -- Cargo delivery effect
reachabilityWeight = 1.0   -- Connectivity effect
trafficPenalty = true      -- Enable slowdown if traffic >80%
decayEnabled = false       -- Enable town shrinking when isolated
```
